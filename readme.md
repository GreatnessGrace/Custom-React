# Custom React-Like Rendering in Vanilla JavaScript

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of custom rendering for React-like elements using vanilla JavaScript.

## Description

The provided code consists of an HTML file and a JavaScript file:

- **HTML File (index.html):**
  - Contains a basic structure for a web page with a `<div>` element with the id `root` where our React-like element will be rendered.
  - Includes a `<script>` tag linking to a JavaScript file named `customReact.js`.

- **JavaScript File (customReact.js):**
  - Defines a `customRender` function that takes a React-like element and a container DOM element, and renders the element inside the container.
  - Demonstrates how to create a DOM element based on the type and properties of the React-like element, set its inner HTML and attributes, and append it to the container.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. You should see the rendered React-like element inside the `<div id="root">` element.
